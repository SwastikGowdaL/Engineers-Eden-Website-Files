<p> 	    In our college labs we use turbo c++ compiler which you all know how that it is so tiring to code and also at many times the compiler just frustrates you in such a way that you would lose confidence on your error free perfect logic code. So here are some cool compilers that reduces your time with writing the code and even compiling your code in right way</p> 
 <p><h4>1 - Code Blocks</h4>
Code::Blocks is a free C, C++ and Fortran IDE built to meet the most demanding needs of its users. It is designed to be very extensible and fully configurable.
Finally, an IDE with all the features you need, having a consistent look, feel and operation across platforms.

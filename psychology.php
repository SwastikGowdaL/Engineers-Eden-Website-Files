<h2>What is Psychology?</h2>
<p>Psychology is the study of physical behaviour and also the way your mind reacts to every situation.People who study Psychology develop a great understanding about themselves and people around them and they are so called Psychologists.Psychologists also play a vital role in health care by caring for individuals experiencing mental health issues, performing psychotherapy, investigating treatment options, and teaching patients how to manage their symptoms effectively.</p><br>
<h2><b>Daily Psychology</b></h2>
<p>Psychology is not just an academic subject that exists only in classrooms, research labs, and mental health offices. The principles of psychology can be seen all around you in everyday situations.</p>

<p>The television commercials and print ads you see every day rely on psychology to develop marketing messages that influence and persuade people to purchase the advertised products. The websites you visit on a regular basis utilize psychology to understand how people read, use, and interpret online information.</p>

<p>Psychology can also play a role in improving your health and well-being. For example, understanding some of the basic principles of behavioral psychology might come in handy if you are trying to break a bad habit and establish new routines.</p>
<h2><b>Carrier in Psychology</b></h2>
<p>every emotion that hinders your normal behaviour has an answer in psychology to cure it, no matter about the age<br>
If your child is experiencing problems at school, you might seek advice from a school psychologist who specializes in helping kids deal with academic, social, emotional, and other issues. If you are concerned about an elderly parent or grandparent, you might want to consult with a developmental psychologist who is specially trained and knowledgeable in issues related to the aging process.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about majoring in psychology, there are many career paths to choose from. These depend largely on your educational level and work experience, so it is important to research the training and licensing requirements of your chosen specialty area. Just a few of the possible career options include clinical psychology, forensic psychology, health psychology, and industrial-organizational psychology.</p>
<h2><b>Psychology to humankind</b></h2> 
<p>Among the major goals of psychology are to describe, explain, predict, and improve human behavior. Some psychologists accomplish this by contributing to our basic understanding of how people think, feel, and behave. Others work in applied settings to solve real-world problems that have an impact on everyday life.</p>
<p>And finally, many psychologists devote their lives to helping people who are struggling with psychological issues. You may find these professionals working in hospitals, mental health clinics, private practices, and other settings to diagnose psychological disorders and provide psychotherapy to people from all walks of life.</p>
<h4><i> In this era of social life people get worried to every small reason that goes against their expectation and those people being weak hearted land up in worst things that ruin thier life.So there is a definite need of a psychologist to heal all these....</i><h4>

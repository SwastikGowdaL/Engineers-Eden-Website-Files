		  </div>
		  <div class="modal-body">
<p>Deep learning is a hot topic these days. But what is it that makes it special and sets it apart from other aspects of machine learning? That is a deep question (pardon the pun). To even begin to answer it, we will need to learn the basics of neural networks.
Neural networks are the workhorses of deep learning. And while they may look like black boxes, deep down (sorry, I will stop the terrible puns) they are trying to accomplish the same thing as any other model — to make good predictions.
In this post, we will explore the ins and outs of a simple neural network. And by the end, hopefully you (and I) will have gained a deeper and more intuitive understanding of how neural networks do what they do.</p>
<br>
<h><b>The 30,000 Feet View</b></h>
<br>
<p>Let’s start with a really high level overview so we know what we are working with. Neural networks are multi-layer networks of neurons (the blue and magenta nodes in the chart below) that we use to classify things, make predictions, etc. Below is the diagram of a simple neural network with five inputs, 5 outputs, and two hidden layers of neurons.</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn2.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>Starting from the left, we have:<br>
1-The input layer of our model in orange.<br>
2-Our first hidden layer of neurons in blue.<br>
3-Our second hidden layer of neurons in magenta.<br>
4-The output layer (a.k.a. the prediction) of our model in green.<br>
The arrows that connect the dots shows how all the neurons are interconnected and how data travels from the input layer all the way through to the output layer.
Later we will calculate step by step each output value. We will also watch how the neural network learns from its mistake using a process known as backpropagation.</p>
<br>
<h><b>Getting our Bearings</b></h>
<br>
<p>But first let’s get our bearings. What exactly is a neural network trying to do? Like any other model, it’s trying to make a good prediction. We have a set of inputs and a set of target values — and we are trying to get predictions that match those target values as closely as possible.
Forget for a second the more complicated looking picture of the neural network I drew above and focus on this simpler one below.</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn3.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>This is a single feature logistic regression (we are giving the model only one X variable) expressed through a neural network (if you need a refresher on logistic regression, I wrote about that here). To see how they connect we can rewrite the logistic regression equation using our neural network color codes.</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn4.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>Let’s examine each element:<br>
1-X (in orange) is our input, the lone feature that we give to our model in order to calculate a prediction.<br>
2-B1 (in turquoise, a.k.a. blue-green) is the estimated slope parameter of our logistic regression — B1 tells us by how much the Log_Odds change as X changes. Notice that B1 lives on the turquoise line, which connects the input X to the blue neuron in Hidden Layer 1.<br>
3-B0 (in blue) is the bias — very similar to the intercept term from regression. The key difference is that in neural networks, every neuron has its own bias term (while in regression, the model has a singular intercept term).<br>
4-The blue neuron also includes a sigmoid activation function (denoted by the curved line inside the blue circle). Remember the sigmoid function is what we use to go from log-odds to probability (do a control-f search for “sigmoid” in my previous post).<br>
5-And finally we get our predicted probability by applying the sigmoid function to the quantity (B1*X + B0).<br>
Not too bad right? So let’s recap. A super simple neural network consists of just the following components:<br>
*A connection (though in practice, there will generally be multiple connections, each with its own weight, going into a particular neuron), with a weight “living inside it”, that transforms your input (using B1) and gives it to the neuron.<br>
*A neuron that includes a bias term (B0) and an activation function (sigmoid in our case).<br>
And these two objects are the fundamental building blocks of the neural network. More complex neural networks are just models with more hidden layers and that means more neurons and more connections between neurons. And this more complex web of connections (and weights and biases) is what allows the neural network to “learn” the complicated relationships hidden in our data.</p>
<br>
<h><b>Let’s Add a Bit of Complexity Now</b></h>
<br>
<p>Now that we have our basic framework, let’s go back to our slightly more complicated neural network and see how it goes from input to output. Here it is again for reference:</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn2.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>The first hidden layer consists of two neurons. So to connect all five inputs to the neurons in Hidden Layer 1, we need ten connections. The next image (below) shows just the connections between Input 1 and Hidden Layer 1.</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn5.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>Note our notation for the weights that live in the connections — W1,1 denotes the weight that lives in the connection between Input 1 and Neuron 1 and W1,2 denotes the weight in the connection between Input 1 and Neuron 2. So the general notation that I will follow is Wa,b denotes the weight on the connection between Input a (or Neuron a) and Neuron b.
Now let’s calculate the outputs of each neuron in Hidden Layer 1 (known as the activations). We do so using the following formulas (W denotes weight, In denotes input).
Z1 = W1*In1 + W2*In2 + W3*In3 + W4*In4 + W5*In5 + Bias_Neuron1
Neuron 1 Activation = Sigmoid(Z1)
We can use matrix math to summarize this calculation (remember our notation rules — for example, W4,2 denotes the weight that lives in the connection between Input 4 and Neuron 2):</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn6.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>For any layer of a neural network where the prior layer is m elements deep and the current layer is n elements deep, this generalizes to:
[W] @ [X] + [Bias] = [Z]
Where [W] is your n by m matrix of weights (the connections between the prior layer and the current layer), [X] is your m by 1 matrix of either starting inputs or activations from the prior layer, [Bias] is your n by 1 matrix of neuron biases, and [Z] is your n by 1 matrix of intermediate outputs. In the previous equation, I follow Python notation and use @ to denote matrix multiplication. Once we have [Z], we can apply the activation function (sigmoid in our case) to each element of [Z] and that gives us our neuron outputs (activations) for the current layer.
Finally before we move on, let’s visually map each of these elements back onto our neural network chart to tie it all up ([Bias] is embedded in the blue neurons).</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn7.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>By repeatedly calculating [Z] and applying the activation function to it for each successive layer, we can move from input to output. This process is known as forward propagation. Now that we know how the outputs are calculated, it’s time to start evaluating the quality of the outputs and training our neural network.</p>
<br>
<h><b>Time for the Neural Network to Learn</b></h>
<br>
<p>This is going to be a long post so feel free to take a coffee break now. Still with me? Awesome! Now that we know how a neural network’s output values are calculated, it is time to train it.
The training process of a neural network, at a high level, is like that of many other data science models — define a cost function and use gradient descent optimization to minimize it.
First let’s think about what levers we can pull to minimize the cost function. In traditional linear or logistic regression we are searching for beta coefficients (B0, B1, B2, etc.) that minimize the cost function. For a neural network, we are doing the same thing but at a much larger and more complicated scale.
In traditional regression, we can change any particular beta in isolation without impacting the other beta coefficients. So by applying small isolated shocks to each beta coefficient and measuring its impact on the cost function, it is relatively straightforward to figure out in which direction we need to move to reduce and eventually minimize the cost function.</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn8.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>In a neural network, changing the weight of any one connection (or the bias of a neuron) has a reverberating effect across all the other neurons and their activations in the subsequent layers.
That’s because each neuron in a neural network is like its own little model. For example, if we wanted a five feature logistic regression, we could express it through a neural network, like the one on the left, using just a singular neuron!
So each hidden layer of a neural network is basically a stack of models (each individual neuron in the layer acts like its own model) whose outputs feed into even more models further downstream (each successive hidden layer of the neural network holds yet more neurons).</p>
<br>
<h><b>The Cost Function</b></h>
<br>
<p>So given all this complexity, what can we do? It’s actually not that bad. Let’s take it step by step. First, let me clearly state our objective. Given a set of training inputs (our features) and outcomes (the target we are trying to predict):
We want to find the set of weights (remember that each connecting line between any two elements in a neural network houses a weight) and biases (each neuron houses a bias) that minimize our cost function — where the cost function is an approximation of how wrong our predictions are relative to the target outcome.
For training our neural network, we will use Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the cost function:
MSE = Sum [ ( Prediction - Actual )² ] * (1 / num_observations)
The MSE of a model tell us on average how wrong we are but with a twist — by squaring the errors of our predictions before averaging them, we punish predictions that are way off much more severely than ones that are just slightly off. The cost functions of linear regression and logistic regression operate in a very similar manner.
OK cool, we have a cost function to minimize. Time to fire up gradient descent right?
Not so fast — to use gradient descent, we need to know the gradient of our cost function, the vector that points in the direction of greatest steepness (we want to repeatedly take steps in the opposite direction of the gradient to eventually arrive at the minimum).
Except in a neural network we have so many changeable weights and biases that are all interconnected. How will we calculate the gradient of all of that? In the next section, we will see how backpropagation helps us deal with this problem.</p>
<br>
<h><b>Quick Review of Gradient Descent</b></h>
<br>
<p>The gradient of a function is the vector whose elements are its partial derivatives with respect to each parameter. For example, if we were trying to minimize a cost function, C(B0, B1), with just two changeable parameters, B0 and B1, the gradient would be:
Gradient of C(B0, B1) = [ [dC/dB0], [dC/dB1] ] </p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn9.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>So each element of the gradient tells us how the cost function would change if we applied a small change to that particular parameter — so we know what to tweak and by how much. To summarize, we can march towards the minimum by following these steps:</p>
<br>
<p>Compute the gradient of our “current location” (calculate the gradient using our current parameter values).
Modify each parameter by an amount proportional to its gradient element and in the opposite direction of its gradient element. For example, if the partial derivative of our cost function with respect to B0 is positive but tiny and the partial derivative with respect to B1 is negative and large, then we want to decrease B0 by a tiny amount and increase B1 by a large amount to lower our cost function.
Recompute the gradient using our new tweaked parameter values and repeat the previous steps until we arrive at the minimum.</p>
<br>
<h><b>Backpropagation</b></h>
<br>
<p>I will defer to this great textbook (online and free!) for the detailed math (if you want to understand neural networks more deeply, definitely check it out). Instead we will do our best to build an intuitive understanding of how and why backpropagation works.
Remember that forward propagation is the process of moving forward through the neural network (from inputs to the ultimate output or prediction). Backpropagation is the reverse. Except instead of signal, we are moving error backwards through our model.
Some simple visualizations helped a lot when I was trying to understand the backpropagation process. Below is my mental picture of a simple neural network as it forward propagates from input to output. The process can be summarized by the following steps:
Inputs are fed into the blue layer of neurons and modified by the weights, bias, and sigmoid in each neuron to get the activations. For example: Activation_1 = Sigmoid( Bias_1 + W1*Input_1 )
Activation 1 and Activation 2, which come out of the blue layer are fed into the magenta neuron, which uses them to produce the final output activation.
And the objective of forward propagation is to calculate the activations at each neuron for each successive hidden layer until we arrive at the output.</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn10.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>Now let’s just reverse it. If you follow the red arrows (in the picture below), you will notice that we are now starting at the output of the magenta neuron. That is our output activation, which we use to make our prediction, and the ultimate source of error in our model. We then move this error backwards through our model via the same weights and connections that we use for forward propagating our signal (so instead of Activation 1, now we have Error1 — the error attributable to the top blue neuron).
Remember we said that the goal of forward propagation is to calculate neuron activations layer by layer until we get to the output? We can now state the objective of backpropagation in a similar manner:
We want to calculate the error attributable to each neuron (I will just refer to this error quantity as the neuron’s error because saying “attributable” again and again is no fun) starting from the layer closest to the output all the way back to the starting layer of our model.</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn11.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>So why do we care about the error for each neuron? Remember that the two building blocks of a neural network are the connections that pass signals into a particular neuron (with a weight living in each connection) and the neuron itself (with a bias). These weights and biases across the entire network are also the dials that we tweak to change the predictions made by the model.
This part is really important:
The magnitude of the error of a specific neuron (relative to the errors of all the other neurons) is directly proportional to the impact of that neuron’s output (a.k.a. activation) on our cost function.
So the error of each neuron is a proxy for the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to that neuron’s inputs. This makes intuitive sense — if a particular neuron has a much larger error than all the other ones, then tweaking the weights and bias of our offending neuron will have a greater impact on our model’s total error than fiddling with any of the other neurons.
And the partial derivatives with respect to each weight and bias are the individual elements that compose the gradient vector of our cost function. So basically backpropagation allows us to calculate the error attributable to each neuron and that in turn allows us to calculate the partial derivatives and ultimately the gradient so that we can utilize gradient descent. Hurray!</p>
<br>
<h><b>An Analogy that Helps — The Blame Game</b></h>
<br>
<p>That’s a lot to digest so hopefully this analogy will help. Almost everyone has had a terrible colleague at some point in his or her life — someone who would always play the blame game and throw coworkers or subordinates under the bus when things went wrong.</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/nn12.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<p>Well neurons, via backpropagation, are masters of the blame game. When the error gets backpropagated to a particular neuron, that neuron will quickly and efficiently point the finger at the upstream colleague (or colleagues) who is most at fault for causing the error (i.e. layer 4 neurons would point the finger at layer 3 neurons, layer 3 neurons at layer 2 neurons, and so forth).</p>
<br>
<p>And how does each neuron know who to blame, as the neurons cannot directly observe the errors of other neurons? They just look at who sent them the most signal in terms of the highest and most frequent activations. Just like in real life, the lazy ones that play it safe (low and infrequent activations) skate by blame free while the neurons that do the most work get blamed and have their weights and biases modified. Cynical yes but also very effective for getting us to the optimal set of weights and biases that minimize our cost function. To the left is a visual of how the neurons throw each other under the bus.
And that in a nutshell is the intuition behind the backpropagation process. In my opinion, these are the three key takeaways for backpropagation:<br>
1-It is the process of shifting the error backwards layer by layer and attributing the correct amount of error to each neuron in the neural network.<br>
2-The error attributable to a particular neuron is a good approximation for how changing that neuron’s weights (from the connections leading into the neuron) and bias will affect the cost function.<br>
3-When looking backwards, the more active neurons (the non-lazy ones) are the ones that get blamed and tweaked by the backpropagation process.</p>
<br>
<h><b>Tying it All Together</b></h>
<br>
<p>If you have read all the way here, then you have my gratitude and admiration (for your persistence).
We started with a question, “What makes deep learning special?” I will attempt to answer that now (mainly from the perspective of basic neural networks and not their more advanced cousins like CNNs, RNNs, etc.). In my humble opinion, the following aspects make neural networks special:<br>
*Each neuron is its own miniature model with its own bias and set of incoming features and weights.<br>
*Each individual model/neuron feeds into numerous other individual neurons across all the hidden layers of the model. So we end up with models plugged into other models in a way where the sum is greater than its parts. This allows neural networks to fit all the nooks and crannies of our data including the nonlinear parts (but beware overfitting — and definitely consider regularization to protect your model from underperforming when confronted with new and out of sample data).<br>
*The versatility of the many interconnected models approach and the ability of the backpropagation process to efficiently and optimally set the weights and biases of each model lets the neural network to robustly “learn” from data in ways that many other algorithms cannot.</p>

<p style='color: indigo'><i>" Everything which happens around you in real time has no meaning until you capture that happening in a photo but even though the photo seems to be simple but depicting an inner enlightening meaning as an art is called photography "</p>   
<p> This article is mainly to convey a meaning like a watch having a minute hand and an hour hand , the "minute hand" is to give a tribute those photographers who made this world look in a artstic view and the major "hour hand" is to inspire young minds towards this art and to motivate them to make a difference in this field like an hour hand in a watch clock.<br>So let's start exploring..... </p>
<h3>Annie Leibovitz</h3>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/vani.jpg" alt="">
<p>Annie Leibovitz is a portrait photographer who in 1970 landed a job at Rolling Stone and went on to create a distinctive look for the publication as chief photographer. In 1983, she began working for the entertainment magazine Vanity Fair, continuing to produce images that would be deemed iconic and provocative. Having also worked on high-profile advertising campaigns, Leibovitz's images have been showcased in several books and major exhibitions around the world. </p>
<p>To date, a number of Vanity Fair covers have featured Leibovitz’s stunning—and often controversial—portraits of celebrities. Demi Moore (very pregnant and very nude followed by a body painting shoot), Whoopi Goldberg (half-submerged in a bathtub of milk), Sylvester Stallone (appearing nude in a pose inspired by Rodin's "The Thinker") and Caitlyn Jenner (in a corset after having publicly revealed her identity as a woman) are among the most remembered celebs to grace the cover. Known for her ability to make her sitters become physically involved in her work, another of Leibovitz’s most famous portraits is of the late artist Keith Haring, who painted himself like a canvas for the photo.</p>
<p>She uses a very distinct lighting setup which delivers a muted almost painterly image. Her photographs are very recognizable if you have studies her work even for a short period of time. Consistency in your photographic style is a great skill to attain because it means people can easily recognize your work and you will get hired more.</p>
<p>She has got the prestigious awards like " Glamour Award For The Visionary " and " Honorary Clio Award "</p>
<p>Her very known works was published as a book by her as " A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005 " where it was all about her works as depicted as photos</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cG_w896Z2g">click here to view her works in that book explained by a photographer</a></p>
<h3>Gregory Crewdson</h3>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/vgeo.jpg" alt="">
<p>Gregory Crewdson (American, b.1962) is best known for his photographs, which feature elaborately staged, surreal tableaus of suburban life. Born in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, Crewdson played in a punk rock band as a teenager, before attending the State University of New York at Purchase, where he earned his BFA. After completing his MFA at Yale University in 1988, Crewdson began working on the first of his many lengthy photographic series, Natural Wonder, depicting highly constructed scenes showing the grotesque narratives of paranoia, lust, and fantasy that are played out in suburbia.</p>
<p>Crewdson’s subsequent series, Hover (1995) and Twilight (2003), document dramatic and strange occurrences within typical middle-class neighborhoods, creating bizarre and unsettling images within fairly ordinary settings. Since 1993, Crewdson has served as a professor at Yale University, where he continues to teach and work today. Crewdson’s photographs have proven to be successful both in and outside of gallery settings; in addition to numerous shows at White Cube gallery in London, his work has been used in HBO advertisements and trailers for the popular television series, Six Feet Under (2001–2005).</p>          
<p>He spends thousands and even millions of dollars to create a single photograph. Imagine the set of a major motion picture being used for one single image. Gregory began experimenting with these large-scale sets in college and just keep making them more extravagant.</p>

<h3>Richard Avedon</h3>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/vric.jpg" alt="">
<p>American photographer Richard Avedon was best known for his work in the fashion world and for his minimalist portraits. He worked first as a photographer for the Merchant Marines, taking identification photos. He then moved to fashion, shooting for Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, demanding that his models convey emotion and movement, a departure from the norm of motionless fashion photography.</p>
<p>While some regarded this work as a fashion and portrait photographer as poking fun at blue collar workers, I think that it sheds a beautiful light on the professions these people had. It offered viewers in galleries and insight into everyday life and work that they were not accustomed to and put it right in front of their faces to experience. These images are also stunningly beautiful works of art.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltxph09O3Qk">click here to view his works explianed by a photographer</a></p>
<h3>Elliott Erwitt</h3>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/vell.jpg" alt="">
<p>Moving away from large format photography, Elliott Erwitt primarily shot on a 35mm camera. Erwitt was originally from France and immigrated to the United States to go to college. He worked as a photography assistant in the US army where he honed his skills.</p>
<p>Elliott focused a lot of his attention on street photography and is one of the wittiest street photographers ever to grace the earth. His images are both deep and funny at the same time images. If you like street photography, Elliott Erwitt will blow you away!</p>

<h3>Vivian Maier</h3>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/vvm.jpg" alt="">
<p>Probably known as one of the most interesting secret photographers of all time, Vivian Maier did not become famous until after her death. In 2007 John Maloof purchased a trunk of negatives and undeveloped film from an auction. Little did he know that the contents of this trunk would include thousands of images by a soon to be a well-known photographer named Vivian Maier.</p>
<p>What we now know about Vivian is that she spent her life as a nanny. She mainly photographed on a twin lens 6×6 camera and brought it everywhere she went. The majority of her photographs were taken in Chicago and New York. She simply photographed everything that interested her when she walked down the streets.</p>
<p>Although she was known to be reclusive and weird, her photographs do not depict this side of her. Vivian’s images are bold showing strangers staring right into her camera. I can only imagine what people thought when they noticed a nanny pointing a camera at them on the streets of Chicago.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Vivian Maier I recommend watching a wonderful documentary made about her entitled Finding Vivian Maier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4djabjkQzkE&t=141s">click on this to view the trailer of the " Finding Vivan Maier "</a></p>
<p style='color: indigo'>" After seeing all those works of remarkable people we just feel not only to click a quality photo but an art of understanding each photo you click must be medium to carry some emotions... "</p>

			<h4 class="modal-title">Basic Knowledge About Marketing</h4>
		  </div>
		  <div class="modal-body">
	
<p style='color: indigo'><i>" You just see any items around you, whether have you purchased it from online or any stores nearby... The thing is what made you to buy that item other than "requirement" as a basic reason, means what made you to buy that product itself ? you would just recall about the advertisements on tv,banners on road, the product physical appearence.... etc etc . All these are marketing "</p>
<h3>What is Marketing</h3>
<p>In simplest terms, marketing is the act of driving profitable customer action. It spans the full scope of strategies and tactics organizations use to position products and services in the marketplace, and motivate target audiences to make a purchase.</p>
<h3>Key things about marketing</h3>
<p>For all its complexity, at its core, marketing revolves around four things ,Also called as 4p's: product, price, promotion, and place. Tactics and channels change, but these are the concepts everything else revolves around, and they’re principles that never change.</p>
<p><b>Product:</b>A simple definition of a product (in marketing terms) is “anything that meets a consumer and provides value that can be obtained by a customer through a marketing exchange.<br>
The three things to be known about the product in the view of marketing is:<br>
1>Presenting the product mainly dealing with physical appearence.<br>
2>Finding the difference from other competative products<br>
3>How well it is serviced like about warranties, handling returns..etc<br></p>
<p><b>Price:</b>If marketing is all about driving profitable action, then prices need to be set at a level the market will support.<br>
Things about price to be in notice:<br>
1>Marketing rate per unit of the product:some market analysis and competitive researches determine what’s a fair price for a product, given its cost to produce, and what people are willing to pay.<br>
2>Discounts and its time of release<br>
3>The option of Payment to be easier<br></p>
<p><b>Place:</b>The right product needs to be in the right place for people to find it and buy it.<br>
1>The place where the product gets it value as it is a requiremnt to that locality.<br>
2>People in that place must have a knowledge about it.<br>   
3>Even if it is sold online/offline matters.<br>
<p><b>Promotion:</b>One of the main streams where most of the products fail to reach the right customers it needs<br>
So to be cautious in this we have to look out for this:<br>
1>Channels you use to promote the product means like offline or online.<br>
2>Reading people requiremnets on that basis designing to promote.<br>
3>It is also required to know the marketing psychology towards the people.<br>
4>To know what message to be conveyed and how effective to be conveyed.<br>
<h3>Types Of Marketing</h3>
<p><b>1. Paid advertising</b>:
This includes multiple approaches for marketing. It includes traditional approaches like TVCs and print media advertising. Also, one of the most well-known marketing approach is internet marketing. It includes various methods like PPC (Pay per click) and paid advertising.
<br>
<b>2. Cause marketing</b>:
Cause marketing links the services and products of a company to a social cause or issue. It is also well known as cause related marketing.
<br>
<b>3. Relationship marketing</b>:
This type of marketing is basically focused on customer building. Enhancing existing relationships with customers and improving customer loyalty.
<br>
<b>4. Undercover marketing</b>:
This type of marketing strategy focuses on marketing the product while customers remain unaware of the marketing strategy. It is also known as stealth marketing.
<br>
<b>5. Word of mouth</b>:
It totally relies on what impression you leave on people. It is traditionally the most important type of marketing strategy. Being heard is important in business world. When you give quality services to customers, it is likely that they’d promote you.
<br>
<b>6. Internet marketing</b>:
It is also known as cloud marketing. It usually happens over the internet. All the marketing items are shared on the internet and promoted on various platforms via multiple approaches.
<br>
<b>7. Transactional marketing</b>:
Sales is particularly the most challenging work. Even for the largest retailers, selling is always tough especially when there are high volume targets. However with the new marketing strategies, selling isn’t as difficult as it was. In transactional marketing the retailers encourage customers to buy with shopping coupons, discounts and huge events. It enhances the chances of sales and motivates the target audience to buy the promoted products.
<br>
<b>8. Diversity marketing</b>:
It caters diverse audience by customizing and integrating different marketing strategies. It covers different aspects like cultural, beliefs, attitudes, views and other specific needs.
<br>
<p style='color: indigo'>" So marketing is not just publicly vocalize about the product which you need to sell it's all about the care what you have taken to build the product the same care should be towards reaching the customers and understanding them "</p>

<p><i>" Computer was invented to complete the job easier and effecient but how much ever the features are made uncomplicated the users want to complete the job as simple as one touch.... So to achieve this Machine Learning is the only way "</p>
<h2>What is Machine Learning ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is getting computers to program themselves. If programming is automation, then machine learning is automating the process of automation.
In simple words writing software is the bottleneck, we don’t have enough good developers. Let the data do the work instead of people. Machine learning is the way to make programming scalable.<br>
The basic difference is :<br>
>Traditional Programming: Data and program is run on the computer to produce the output.
>Machine Learning: Data and output is run on the computer to create a program. This program can be used in traditional programming.</p>
<h2>Basic elements in Machine learning</h2>
<p>Every machine learning algorithm has three components:<br>
<b>Representation:</b> how to represent knowledge. Examples include decision trees, sets of rules, instances, graphical models, neural networks, support vector machines, model ensembles and others.<br>
<b>Evaluation:</b> the way to evaluate candidate programs (hypotheses). Examples include accuracy, prediction and recall, squared error, likelihood, posterior probability, cost, margin, entropy k-L divergence and others.<br>
<b>Optimization:</b> the way candidate programs are generated known as the search process. For example combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, constrained optimization.<br></p>
<h2>Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
<p><b>Web search:</b> ranking page based on what you are most likely to click on.<br>
<b>Computational biology:</b> rational design drugs in the computer based on past experiments.<br>
<b>Finance:</b> decide who to send what credit card offers to. Evaluation of risk on credit offers. How to decide where to invest money.<br>
<b>E-commerce:</b>  Predicting customer churn. Whether or not a transaction is fraudulent.<br>
<b>Space exploration:</b> space probes and radio astronomy.<br>
<b>Robotics:</b> how to handle uncertainty in new environments. Autonomous. Self-driving car.<br>
<b>Information extraction:</b> Ask questions over databases across the web.<br>
<b>Social networks:</b> Data on relationships and preferences. Machine learning to extract value from data.<br>
<b>Debugging:</b> Use in computer science problems like debugging. Labor intensive process. Could suggest where the bug could be.<br></p>
<h2>Types of learning</h2>
<p>There are four types of machine learning:<br>
<b>Supervised learning:</b> (also called inductive learning) Training data includes desired outputs.  This is spam this is not, learning is supervised.<br>
<b>Unsupervised learning:</b> Training data does not include desired outputs. Example is clustering. It is hard to tell what is good learning and what is not.<br>
<b>Semi-supervised learning:</b> Training data includes a few desired outputs.<br>
<b>Reinforcement learning:</b> Rewards from a sequence of actions. AI types like it, it is the most ambitious type of learning.<br>
Supervised learning is the most mature, the most studied and the type of learning used by most machine learning algorithms. Learning with supervision is much easier than learning without supervision.</p>
<b>" Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence but without Machine Learning Artifical Intelligence makes the bird without wings "</b>

		  </div>
		  <div class="modal-body">
		 <p><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/tel.jpg" alt=""><hr> </p>
       <p>  <b> 1.Unlimited server storage - </b>
         <br>
         <br>
Telegram provides unlimited storage. Means all your text messages, images media files & documents will be saved on their cloud. You can log out and log in any number of times from any number of devices simultaneously without losing any data, you don’t need to worry about backup & restore. You can view the active sessions and see on which devices are you logged in now. Thereby you can download any file any time anywhere.<hr></p>

<p><b>2. Media compression-</b>
<br>
<br>
Users can choose whether to compress the image and video or send the uncompressed version.<hr></p>
<p><b>3. Group member number capacity-</b>
<br>
<br>
A normal group capacity in Telegram is 200. But when this is reached the Group transforms to a Super Group with a capacity of 5000. (A Super Group has some more features than a Normal Group)<hr></p>
<p><b>4. Username feature-</b>
<br>
<br>
You can communicate with anyone on telegram even if you don't have the contact number of others. This ensures the privacy of the user’s contact number.<hr></p>
<p><b>5. Channels-</b>
<br>
<br>
A channel is somewhat similar to groups, which can accommodate an unlimited number of members. The creator of the channel can decide who can post and other members can view the posts.<hr></p>
<p><b>6 Multi-platform support-</b>
<br>
<br>
Telegram is available for Android, ios, windows phone, windows pc, Mac os, Linux os and even through any browser.<hr></p>
<p><b>7. Secret chat-</b>
<br>
<br>
Secret chat is a kind of end to end encrypted chat in which one can set self-destruct timer. The messages will be automatically deleted when the timer hits. It is possibly not able to hack in any way.<hr></p>
<p><b>8. Bots-</b>
<br>
<br>
It is a piece of program which is based on AI and machine learning at a small level. It can perform various tasks. For example, an image bot can fetch images from the name.
There are multiple types of bots. Popular bots are Image bot, sticker bot, gif bot.<hr></p>
<p><b>9. Voice calls-</b>
<br>
<br>
The latest version of telegram supports voice calls.<hr></p>
<p><b>10. Sends any kind of file-</b>
<br>
<br>
Users can send any kind of file through Telegram. Whatsapp limits video, images & document type files. This is not nice for advanced users.<hr></p>
<p><b>11. Multiple sessions-</b>
<br>
<br>
Users on telegram can log in on multiple devices at the same time and able to receive messages on all devices.
They can remember their sessions on even browsers too. This is a cool feature.

			<h4 class="modal-title">so what's the difference b/w 1G,2G,3G,4G,5G.. </h4>
		  </div>
		  <div class="modal-body">
		<p>What are the differences between 2G, 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G networks?<br>
<br>
•	Simply, the “G” stands for “GENERATION”. While connected to the internet, the speed of the connection depends upon the signal strength that is shown in abbreviations like 2G, 3G, and 4G, etc. on any mobile device. Each generation of wireless broadband is defined as a set of telephone network standards that describe the technological implementation of the system.
<br>
 </p>	
		 <p><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/2g.jpg" alt=""><hr> </p>
<p> <b>First Generation (1G) </b><br>
<br>
•	 These telephones were the first and the foremost cell phones to be utilized, which was presented in 1982 and finished in mid-1990. It was utilized for voice benefits and depended on the technology called Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS). The AMPS framework was frequency modulated and utilized the frequency division multiple access (FDMA) with a channel limited to 30 KHz and with a frequency band of 824- 894 MHz<br>
<br>
•	The primary highlights of 1G are: Speed- 2.4 Kbps, Allows voice brings in one nation, Use analog signal, Poor voice quality, Poor battery life, large phone measure, Limited capacity, poor handoff unwavering quality, Poor security, and Offered low level of spectrum efficiency.<br>
<br>
•	It presents Mobile Technologies, for example, Mobile Telephone System (MTS), Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMTS), Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) and Push to Talk (PTT). It has low capacity, problematic hand-off, poor voice quality and no security at all since voice gets back to be played in radio towers, making these calls helpless to undesirable in listening stealthily by outsiders.<br>
<br>
•	The main drawback of 1G technology is that it uses analog signals rather than digital signals, this is less effective means of transmitting information, it is slower, and the signals cannot reach as far in terms of secluded areas so 2G is coming to overcome these problems.<br>
<hr></p>
<p> <b>SECOND GENERATION (2G) </b><br>
<br>
•	2G refers to the second generation of mobile networks based on GSM. The radio signals used by the 1G network were analog, while 2G networks were digital. 2G capabilities were achieved by allowing multiple users on a single channel via multiplexing. During 2G, Cellular phones were used for data also along with voice. Some of the key features of 2G were:<br>
<br>
•	Data speeds of up to 64 kbps<br>
•	Use of digital signals instead of analog<br>
•	Enabled services such as SMS and MMS (Multimedia Message)<br>
•	Provided better quality voice calls<br>
•	It used a bandwidth of 30 to 200 KHz<br>
<hr>
</p>
<p><b>THIRD GENERATION (3G) </b><br>
<br>
•	The 3G standard utilizes Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) as its core network architecture. 3G network combines aspects of the 2G network with new technologies and protocols to deliver a significantly faster data rate. By using packet switching, the original technology was improved to allow speeds up to 14 Mbps. It used Wide Band Wireless Network that increased clarity. It operates at a range of 2100MHz and has a bandwidth of 15-20MHz. Some of the main features of 3G are:<br>
<br>
•	Speed of up to 2 Mbps<br>
•	Increased bandwidth and data transfer rates<br>
•	Send/receive large email messages<br>
•	Large capacities and broadband capabilities<br>
 
International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) were the specifications by the International Telecommunication Union for the 3G network. Theoretically, 21.6 Mbps in the max speed of HSPA+.
<hr>
</p>
<p> <b>FOURTH GENERATION (4G) </b><br>
<br>
•	The main difference between 3G and 4G is the data rate. There is also a huge difference between 3G and 4G technology. The key technologies that have made 4G possible are MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) and OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing). The most important 4G standards are WiMAX and LTE. While 4G LTE is a major improvement over 3G speeds, it is technically not 4G. What is the difference between 4G and LTE?<br>
<br>
•	Even after it was widely available, many networks were not up to the required speed of 4G. 4G LTE is a “fourth generation long term evolution”, capable of delivering a very fast and secure internet connection. Basically, 4G is the predetermined standard for mobile network connections. 4G LTE is the term given to the path which has to be followed to achieve those predefined standards. Some of the features of 4G LTE are:<br>
<br>
•	Support interactive multimedia, voice, video<br>
•	High speed, high capacity and low cost per bit (Speeds of up to 20 Mbps or more)<br>
•	Global and scalable mobile networks.<br>
•	Ad hoc and multi-hop networks.<br>
 <hr>
</p>
<p>  <b>FIFTH GENERATION (5G) </b> <br>
<br>
•	5G uses the rarely used radio millimeter bands in the 30 GHz to 300 GHz Testing of 5G range in mmWave has produced results approximately 500 meters from the tower. Using small cells, carriers using millimetre wave for the deployment of 5G can improve overall coverage area. Combined with Beamforming, small cells can deliver extremely fast coverage with low latency.<br>
<br>
•	Low latency is one of 5G’s most important features. 5G uses a scalable orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) framework. 5G benefits greatly from this and can have latency as low as one millisecond with realistic estimates to be around 1 – 10 seconds. 5G is estimated to be 60 to 120 times faster than the average 4G latency.<br>
<br>
 5G technology will be deployed by 2020. It provides the great feature to users, having higher data rate 1Gbps or higher. 5G support 4G+WWWW (4th Generation +Wireless World Wide Web). It operates on IPv6 protocol. Fifth generation technology utilizes CDMA and BDMA and millimeter wireless which approves speed is higher than 100Mbps at full speed and more prominent than 1Gbps at low speed.<hr>

			<h4 class="modal-title">" Hybrid Cars "</h4>
		  </div>
		  <div class="modal-body">
			 <p><b>What is a hybrid car? </b><br>
<br>
Quite simply, a hybrid combines at least one electric motor with a gasoline engine to move the car, and its system recaptures energy via regenerative braking. Sometimes the electric motor does all the work, sometimes it's the gas engine, and sometimes they work together. The result is less gasoline burned and, therefore, better fuel economy. Adding electric power can even boost performance in certain instances.<br>
<br>
With all of them, electricity comes from a high-voltage battery pack (separate from the car's conventional 12-volt battery) that's replenished by capturing energy from deceleration that's typically lost to heat generated by the brakes in conventional cars. (This happens through the regenerative braking system.) Hybrids also use the gas engine to charge and maintain the battery. Car companies use different hybrid designs to accomplish different missions, ranging from maximum fuel savings to keeping the vehicle's cost as low as possible.<br>
</p>
<p> <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/hyb.jpg" alt=""><hr> </p>
<p> <b>Types in Hybrid cars</b>
<hr>

<b>Parallel Hybrid</b><br>
<br>
In this most common design, the electric motor(s) and gasoline engine are connected in a common transmission that blends the two power sources. That transmission can be an automatic, a manual, or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). One very popular hybrid transmission is a power-split CVT, which is used by the Toyota Prius and Chevrolet Volt. Transmission type and the size of the gasoline engine are the main factors that determine how a parallel hybrid will accelerate, sound, and feel. Brands that use the parallel design include Toyota, Lexus, Hyundai, Kia, Ford, Honda, Lincoln, Nissan, and Infiniti.
<hr>

<b>Series Hybrid</b><br>
<br>
In this design, the electric motor(s) provides all the thrust, and there is never a physical mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels. The gasoline engine is just there to recharge the battery. This results in a driving experience that's more indicative of an electric car, with smoother, powerful acceleration. There's typically less vibration when the gasoline engine engages. However, that engagement doesn't always happen in concert with what your right foot is doing (remember, the battery is making the demands), so the engine might be revving up while the car is cruising at a steady speed. Some find this behavior disconcerting. The BMW i3 with the range extender is an example of a series hybrid.
<hr>

<b>Plug-In Hybrid</b><br>
<br>
A plug-in hybrid enhances the conventional hybrid concept with a much larger battery pack that, like an electric car's, must be fully recharged using an external electricity source—from your home, office, or public charging station. This greater amount of energy storage is like a larger gas tank: It allows for extended all-electric driving (between 15 and 55 miles depending on the model) and can significantly reduce fuel consumption. In fact, if you have a short commute and recharge nightly, you'll be running on electricity most of the time. Should you deplete the all-electric range, the car basically reverts to being a conventional parallel hybrid. The Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid (shown above) is an example of the plug-in breed.

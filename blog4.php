<p><i>" Humans are always found of discovering and inventing new things to this real world that makes his life easier than their past but at one point he surrenders to himself when he deals or encounters some emotions that makes his mind and heart to start his inventions and discoveries to know the cause of that change inside him.... That's where Psychology makes it's stage "</p>
<h2>What is Psychology?</h2>
<p>Psychology is the study of physical behaviour and also the way your mind reacts to every situation.People who study Psychology develop a great understanding about themselves and people around them and they are so called Psychologists.Psychologists also play a vital role in health care by caring for individuals experiencing mental health issues, performing psychotherapy, investigating treatment options, and teaching patients how to manage their symptoms effectively.</p><br>
<h2><b>Daily Psychology</b></h2>
<p>Psychology is not just an academic subject that exists only in classrooms, research labs, and mental health offices. The principles of psychology can be seen all around you in everyday situations.</p>

<p>The television commercials and print ads you see every day rely on psychology to develop marketing messages that influence and persuade people to purchase the advertised products. The websites you visit on a regular basis utilize psychology to understand how people read, use, and interpret online information.</p>

<p>Psychology can also play a role in improving your health and well-being. For example, understanding some of the basic principles of behavioral psychology might come in handy if you are trying to break a bad habit and establish new routines.</p>
<h2><b>Carrier in Psychology</b></h2>
<p>every emotion that hinders your normal behaviour has an answer in psychology to cure it, no matter about the age<br>
If your child is experiencing problems at school, you might seek advice from a school psychologist who specializes in helping kids deal with academic, social, emotional, and other issues. If you are concerned about an elderly parent or grandparent, you might want to consult with a developmental psychologist who is specially trained and knowledgeable in issues related to the aging process.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about majoring in psychology, there are many career paths to choose from. These depend largely on your educational level and work experience, so it is important to research the training and licensing requirements of your chosen specialty area. Just a few of the possible career options include clinical psychology, forensic psychology, health psychology, and industrial-organizational psychology.</p>
<h2><b>Psychology to humankind</b></h2> 
<p>Among the major goals of psychology are to describe, explain, predict, and improve human behavior. Some psychologists accomplish this by contributing to our basic understanding of how people think, feel, and behave. Others work in applied settings to solve real-world problems that have an impact on everyday life.</p>
<p>And finally, many psychologists devote their lives to helping people who are struggling with psychological issues. You may find these professionals working in hospitals, mental health clinics, private practices, and other settings to diagnose psychological disorders and provide psychotherapy to people from all walks of life.</p>
<h4><i> In this era of social life people get worried to every small reason that goes against their expectation and those people being weak hearted land up in worst things that ruin thier life.So there is a definite need of a psychologist to heal all these....</i><h4>

<p><i>" The basic things which are around you in your home or workplace just makes your work easier including human intrevention but one thought which strucks your mind that why can't we create a machine to complete the works without human intrevention.....  that's where the need arises of Artificial Intelligence "</p>
<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>
<h2>Divisions In  Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong. Weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.</p>
<p>Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.</p>
<h2> Applications Of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>The applications for artificial intelligence are endless,The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.<br> It also includes computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.</p>

<p><i>" Educating children about the technology has changed it's view of Educating children by the technology "</p>
<h2>Implementation In Education</h2>
<p><h3>Voice Assistants</h3>
Such voice assistants as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Home allow interacting with various learning materials without communication with a teacher. As a result, it’s possible to use an education platform anywhere and anytime.
For example, Arizona State University uses Alexa for routine campus needs. The assistant can answer common questions or follow the student’s schedule.
Additionally, using such assistants, it quite interesting and exciting for learners, so they are mare engaged in the education process.</p>
<h3>Smart Content</h3>
<p>Smart content stands for various learning materials, from digitized textbooks to customized interfaces.
Let’s consider two examples.</p>
<p>>Content Technologies, Inc. is a development company that works with Artificial Intelligence. Its primary goals are to automate business processes and improve users’ experience. The company has already created solutions for the education field. For example, Cram101 can break the textbook’s content into parts. They can include a chapter summary, tests, and so on.</p>
<p>>Netex Learning is one more company that focuses on creating smart content platforms. The solution is full of AI-based features — for example, real-time feedback and digital curriculum. Netex platform also offers personalized cloud platforms with virtual training, conferences, and more.</p></p>
<h3>Global Learning</h3>
<p>AI brings a lot of opportunities to share knowledge all over the world. Using Artificial Intelligence solutions, students can study various courses and training programs. There are a lot of platforms with interactive learning materials from the best tutors.
AI also provides opportunities for students who speak different languages or have visual or hearing problems. For example, Presentation Translator is an AI-based solution that creates subtitles in real-time mode. Using AI Speech Recognition, students can hear or read in their native language.</p>
<h3>Some Of The AI-based Solution In Education Are:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Third space learning</li>
<li>Little Dragon</li>
<li>CTI</li>
<li>Brainly</li>
<li>Thinker Math</li>
</ul>
<h2> What Are It's Advantages </h2>
<h3> For Students </h3>
<p><b>Education at any time</b>:<br> Young people spend a lot of time on the go. They prefer doing everyday tasks using their smartphones or tablets. AI-based applications provide an opportunity to study in free time, spending ten or fifteen minutes. Additionally, the students can get feedback from tutors in a real-time mode.</p>
<p><b>Various options due to the students’ needs</b>:<br> AI-based solutions can adapt due to the students’ level of knowledge, interesting topics, and so on. The system tends to help students with their weak sides. It offers learning materials based on their weaknesses. For example, the student does the test before starting to use the app the app analyzes it and provides suitable tasks and courses.</p>
<p><b>Virtual mentors</b>:<br> AI-based platforms offer virtual mentors to track the students’ progress. Of course, only human teachers can understand the scholars’ needs better, but it’s good to get instant feedback from the virtual tutor.</p></p>
<h3> For Parents And Teachers</h3>
<p><b>Opportunity to see weaknesses</b>:<br>Different training courses allow seeing the gaps in students’ knowledge. For example, the Coursera platform can notify the teacher if many students chose incorrect answers to a particular question. As a result, the tutor has an opportunity to pay attention to the demanded topic.</p>
<p><b>Curriculum automatic creating</b>:<br> Teachers get a great benefit from AI development. These days, they don’t need to create a curriculum from scratch. As a result, tutors spend less time searching for necessary educational materials.</p>
<p><b>Opportunity to find a good teacher</b>:<br> Educational platforms have a lot of teachers, so the student has an opportunity to communicate with specialists from other countries.

    <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/itt.jpg" alt="">
    <hr>
    <p>An infrared thermometer is a thermometer which infers temperature from a portion of the thermal radiation sometimes called black-body radiation emitted by the object being measured.<br> They are sometimes called laser thermometers as a laser is used to help aim the thermometer, or non-contact thermometers or temperature guns, to describe the device's ability to measure temperature from a distance. <br>By knowing the amount of infrared energy emitted by the object and its emissivity, the object's temperature can often be determined within a certain range of its actual temperature. Infrared thermometers are a subset of devices known as "thermal radiation thermometers".</p>

    <hr>
    <b> Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)</b><br><br>
The first security protocol was named Wired Equivalent Privacy or WEP. It was the standard protocol from 1999 to 2004. While this version was made to protect, it had poor security and was hard to configure.<br><br>
Cryptographic technology imports were restricted at the time, meaning that more manufacturers could only use 64-bit encryption. This is a very low bit encryption compared to the 128-bit or 256-bit options available today. Ultimately, WEP was abandoned for a more advanced solution.
Systems that still use WEP aren’t secure. If you have a system with WEP, it should be upgraded or replaced. When connecting to WiFi, if an establishment has WEP, your Internet activity will not be secure.<hr>
<b>WiFi Protected Access (WPA)</b><br><br>
To improve the functions of WEP, WiFi Protected Access or WPA was created in 2003. This temporary enhancement still has relatively poor security but is easier to configure. WPA uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for more secure encryption than WEP offered.<br><br>
As the WiFi Alliance made this transition to a more advanced protocol, they had to keep some of the same elements of WEP so older devices would still be compatible. Unfortunately, this means vulnerabilities, such as the WiFi Protected Setup feature which can be hacked relatively easily, are still present in the updated version of WPA.<hr>
<b>WiFi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)</b><br><br>
A year later, in 2004, WiFi Protected Access 2 became available. WPA2 has stronger security and is easier to configure than the prior options. The main difference with WPA2 is that it uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) instead of TKIP. AES is able to secure top-secret government information, so it’s a good option for keeping a personal device or company WiFi safe.<br><br>
The only notable vulnerability of WPA2 is that once someone has access to the network, they can attack other devices connected to the network. This is an issue if a company has an internal threat, such as an unhappy employee, who hacks into the other devices on the company’s network.<hr>
<b>WiFi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)</b><br><br>
As vulnerabilities are recognized, advancements are made. In 2018, the WiFi Alliance introduced WPA3. This new version will have, “new features to simplify WiFi security, enable more robust authentication and deliver increased cryptographic strength for highly sensitive data markets.” WPA3 is still being implemented so WPA3-certified hardware isn’t an available option for most people.

		  <div class="modal-body">

    <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/cor.jpg" alt="">
    <hr>
    <p>The treatment protocols for coronavirus are being revised from time to time based on emerging evidences. Here are the drugs, treatment presently available for coronavirus (Covid-19) and what we so far know about them:</p>
    <hr>
	<p> 
   <b> 1) Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ):</b><br>
   <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/hcqs.jpg" alt=""> <br> It was first developed in India for the treatment of malaria. Two Indian firms, Ipca Laboratories and Zydus Cadila Ltd, are the world’s largest manufacturers of the drug. The Indian Council of Medical Research has also been using the drug to prevent infection among healthcare workers based on theoretical evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not allow the novel coronavirus, or SARS-COV2, to attach to cells. HCQ was touted as a potential coronavirus treatment by US President Donald Trump and some other global political leaders.    </p>
   <hr>
    <p><b> 2) Covifor:</b><br><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/cov.jpg" alt=""><br>
     The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has given approval to Hetero for manufacturing ‘Remdesivir’ for the treatment of Covid-19. Hetero’s generic version of Remdesivir will be marketed under the brand name ‘Covifor’ in India. It has been granted approval by DCGI for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in adults and children, hospitalized with severe symptoms of the disease. Covifor (Remdesivir) will be available in 100 mg vial (injectable) which has to be administered intravenously in a hospital setting under the supervision of a healthcare practitioner.</p><hr>
    <p><b> 3) Fabiflu:</b><br><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/fab.jpg" alt=""><br> Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has launched antiviral drug Favipiravir, under the brand name FabiFlu, for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid patients. Priced at ₹103 per tablet, the prescription-based drug will be available as a 200 mg tablet at an MRP of ₹3,500 for a strip of 34 tablets.</p><hr>
    <p><b>4) Cipremi:</b><br> <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/cip.jpg" alt=""><br>Cipla has launched its own <b><i>Remedesivir</i><b> under the name of Cipremi. Cipla said it will be commercialising remdesivir through its own facilities and partnered sites. The drug will be supplied through government and open market channels, to ensure equitable distribution. The drug is most effective on those who need oxygen support. Cipla is yet to disclose the pricing for the drug. </p><hr>
  
    <p><b>5) Methylprednisolone:</b><br> <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/met.jpg" alt=""><br>Indian doctors have been successfully using Methylprednisolone in handling moderate to severe cases of the disease. It reduces its overall mortality and is a more essential part of the treatment regimen. Also, it reduces the severity of symptoms, doctors claimed. Dexamethasone is supported by a large trial and is a cost-effective drug. It is of the same group as Methylprednisone. </p><hr>

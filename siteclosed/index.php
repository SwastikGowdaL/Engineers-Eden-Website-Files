                Sorry to inform you guys that the site is closed due to LACK OF SUPPORT.
            </h3>
            <p class="uc__description">
           Lack of support in the sense we were short on contributors and visitors to our site from all the CSE dept sections and as you guys know our team is made of few members and it was taking forever to maintain and update the site and realized that its not worth our precious time.

<p><i>" The basic things which are around you in your home or workplace just makes your work easier including human intrevention but one thought which strucks your mind that why can't we create a machine to complete the works without human intrevention.....  that's where the need arises of Artificial Intelligence "</p>
<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>
<h2>Divisions In  Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong. Weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.</p>
<p>Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.</p>
<h2> Applications Of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>The applications for artificial intelligence are endless,The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.<br> It also includes computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.</p>

<p><i>" Educating children about the technology has changed it's view of Educating children by the technology "</p>
<h2>Implementation In Education</h2>
<p><h3>Voice Assistants</h3>
Such voice assistants as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Home allow interacting with various learning materials without communication with a teacher. As a result, it’s possible to use an education platform anywhere and anytime.
For example, Arizona State University uses Alexa for routine campus needs. The assistant can answer common questions or follow the student’s schedule.
Additionally, using such assistants, it quite interesting and exciting for learners, so they are mare engaged in the education process.</p>
<h3>Smart Content</h3>
<p>Smart content stands for various learning materials, from digitized textbooks to customized interfaces.
Let’s consider two examples.</p>
<p>>Content Technologies, Inc. is a development company that works with Artificial Intelligence. Its primary goals are to automate business processes and improve users’ experience. The company has already created solutions for the education field. For example, Cram101 can break the textbook’s content into parts. They can include a chapter summary, tests, and so on.</p>
<p>>Netex Learning is one more company that focuses on creating smart content platforms. The solution is full of AI-based features — for example, real-time feedback and digital curriculum. Netex platform also offers personalized cloud platforms with virtual training, conferences, and more.</p></p>
<h3>Global Learning</h3>
<p>AI brings a lot of opportunities to share knowledge all over the world. Using Artificial Intelligence solutions, students can study various courses and training programs. There are a lot of platforms with interactive learning materials from the best tutors.
AI also provides opportunities for students who speak different languages or have visual or hearing problems. For example, Presentation Translator is an AI-based solution that creates subtitles in real-time mode. Using AI Speech Recognition, students can hear or read in their native language.</p>
<h3>Some Of The AI-based Solution In Education Are:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Third space learning</li>
<li>Little Dragon</li>
<li>CTI</li>
<li>Brainly</li>
<li>Thinker Math</li>
</ul>
<h2> What Are It's Advantages </h2>
<h3> For Students </h3>
<p><b>Education at any time</b>:<br> Young people spend a lot of time on the go. They prefer doing everyday tasks using their smartphones or tablets. AI-based applications provide an opportunity to study in free time, spending ten or fifteen minutes. Additionally, the students can get feedback from tutors in a real-time mode.</p>
<p><b>Various options due to the students’ needs</b>:<br> AI-based solutions can adapt due to the students’ level of knowledge, interesting topics, and so on. The system tends to help students with their weak sides. It offers learning materials based on their weaknesses. For example, the student does the test before starting to use the app the app analyzes it and provides suitable tasks and courses.</p>
<p><b>Virtual mentors</b>:<br> AI-based platforms offer virtual mentors to track the students’ progress. Of course, only human teachers can understand the scholars’ needs better, but it’s good to get instant feedback from the virtual tutor.</p></p>
<h3> For Parents And Teachers</h3>
<p><b>Opportunity to see weaknesses</b>:<br>Different training courses allow seeing the gaps in students’ knowledge. For example, the Coursera platform can notify the teacher if many students chose incorrect answers to a particular question. As a result, the tutor has an opportunity to pay attention to the demanded topic.</p>
<p><b>Curriculum automatic creating</b>:<br> Teachers get a great benefit from AI development. These days, they don’t need to create a curriculum from scratch. As a result, tutors spend less time searching for necessary educational materials.</p>
<p><b>Opportunity to find a good teacher</b>:<br> Educational platforms have a lot of teachers, so the student has an opportunity to communicate with specialists from other countries. The AI-enabled educational platform offers appropriate tutors, depending on the teaching experience and soft skills.</p>
<br><p> So in the field of education AI might be a replacements of many old customs of teaching to modernization</p>

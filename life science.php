			<p style='color: red'> BIONICS:</p> <p>The technology coined after two words called biology and electronics. The combination of the electronic system built to encounter the biological requirement to human beings or in other words to achieve the things done by biological system by electronics.
The study of bionics often emphasizes implementing a function found in nature rather than imitating biological structures. For example, in computer science, cybernetics tries to model the feedback and control mechanisms that are inherent in intelligent behavior, while artificial intelligence tries to model the intelligent function regardless of the particular way it can be achieved.</p>

When you're blind, being able to see even the basics of light, movement and shape can make a big difference. Both the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis, currently in FDA trials, and a system being developed by Harvard Research Fellow Dr. John Pezaris record basic visual information via camera, process it into electronic signals and send it wirelessly to implanted electrodes. The Argus II uses electrodes implanted in the eye, which could help people who've lost some of their retinal function. Dr. Pezaris' system, still in the early stages of research, would bypass the eyes entirely, sending visual data straight to the brain. Both systems will work best with people who could once see because their brains will already know how to process the information. "The visual brain depends on visual experience to develop normally," Pezaris explained.

Amputees can now use a prosthetic arm the same way they'd use a real one: By the power of thought. Developed by Dr. Todd Kuiken of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the "bionic arm" is connected to the brain by healthy motor nerves that used to run into the patient's missing limb. These nerves are re-routed to another area of the body, such as the chest, where the nerve impulses they carry can be picked up by electrodes in the bionic arm. When the patient decides to move her hand, the nerves that would have sent the signal to real hand send it to the prosthetic one instead. Now, Dr. Kuiken's team is working on improving the arm, using surviving sensory nerves to communicate the feeling of temperature, vibration and pressure from the bionic arm to the patient's brain.

For people with failing kidneys, basic necessities of life like removing toxins from the blood and keeping fluid levels balanced requires hours hooked up to a dialysis machine the size of a clothes dryer. But a new, portable artificial kidney, small and light enough to fit on a belt system, could change that. Despite its small size, the automated, wearable artificial kidney (AWAK), designed by Martin Roberts and David B.N. Lee of UCLA, actually works better than traditional dialysis because it can be used 24 hours a day, seven days a week, just like a real kidney.

<p>These are very few applications which has been shown here about only human bionics but these are some major inventions which perhaps broke the walls between electronics and biology.</p>

    <p>The treatment protocols for coronavirus are being revised from time to time based on emerging evidences. Here are the drugs, treatment presently available for coronavirus (Covid-19) and what we so far know about them:</p>
    <hr>
	<p> 
   <b> 1) Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ):</b><br>
   <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/hcqs.jpg" alt=""> <br> It was first developed in India for the treatment of malaria. Two Indian firms, Ipca Laboratories and Zydus Cadila Ltd, are the world’s largest manufacturers of the drug. The Indian Council of Medical Research has also been using the drug to prevent infection among healthcare workers based on theoretical evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not allow the novel coronavirus, or SARS-COV2, to attach to cells. HCQ was touted as a potential coronavirus treatment by US President Donald Trump and some other global political leaders.    </p>
   <hr>
    <p><b> 2) Covifor:</b><br><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/cov.jpg" alt=""><br>
     The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has given approval to Hetero for manufacturing ‘Remdesivir’ for the treatment of Covid-19. Hetero’s generic version of Remdesivir will be marketed under the brand name ‘Covifor’ in India. It has been granted approval by DCGI for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in adults and children, hospitalized with severe symptoms of the disease. Covifor (Remdesivir) will be available in 100 mg vial (injectable) which has to be administered intravenously in a hospital setting under the supervision of a healthcare practitioner.</p><hr>
    <p><b> 3) Fabiflu:</b><br><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/fab.jpg" alt=""><br> Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has launched antiviral drug Favipiravir, under the brand name FabiFlu, for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid patients. Priced at ₹103 per tablet, the prescription-based drug will be available as a 200 mg tablet at an MRP of ₹3,500 for a strip of 34 tablets.</p><hr>
    <p><b>4) Cipremi:</b><br> <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/cip.jpg" alt=""><br>Cipla has launched its own <b><i>Remedesivir</i></b> under the name of Cipremi. Cipla said it will be commercialising remdesivir through its own facilities and partnered sites. The drug will be supplied through government and open market channels, to ensure equitable distribution. The drug is most effective on those who need oxygen support. Cipla is yet to disclose the pricing for the drug. </p><hr>
  
    <p><b>5) Methylprednisolone:</b><br> <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/met.jpg" alt=""><br>Indian doctors have been successfully using Methylprednisolone in handling moderate to severe cases of the disease. It reduces its overall mortality and is a more essential part of the treatment regimen. Also, it reduces the severity of symptoms, doctors claimed. Dexamethasone is supported by a large trial and is a cost-effective drug. It is of the same group as Methylprednisone. </p><hr>

          <p><b>Let’s Talk A Little About Cryptocurrency</b><br>Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, are currencies that exist solely in digital. There are no physical golden coins with a big <em>B</em> on them. Moreover, owning these non-real coins entails a new idea of <em>ownership</em>. You don’t literally have it in your hands, or even in your bank account, but you have the ability to transfer <em>ownership</em> to someone else simply by creating a record in the blockchain. Rather than using bills, your transfer is pure data. The Bitcoin protocol is built on the blockchain.<br>
<b>What is Blockchain?</b><br><em>The Blockchain</em> is a public ledger(like  the register a teacher has while taking attendance) where transactions are recorded and confirmed anonymously. It’s a record of events that is shared between many parties. More importantly, once information is entered, it cannot be altered. So, if the blockchain is the public record, what is being recorded? What are all of these <em>transactions</em>?<br>At its most basic level, blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks, but not in the traditional sense of those words. When we say the words <em>block</em> and <em>chain</em> in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”).<br><em>Blocks</em> on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information. Specifically, they have three parts:</p><br><ul><em><li>Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase from Amazon.</li><li>Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. A block for your splurge purchase from Amazon would record your name along with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is recorded without any identifying information using a unique <em>digital signature</em>, sort of like a username.</li><li>Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. Much like you and I have names to distinguish us from one another, each block stores a unique code called a “hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every other block. Hashes are cryptographic codes created by special algorithms. Let’s say you made your splurge purchase on Amazon, but while it’s in transit, you decide you just can’t resist and need a second one. Even though the details of your new transaction would look nearly identical to your earlier purchase, we can still tell the blocks apart because of their unique codes.</li></em></ul><br><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="img/Blockchain.jpg" alt=""><br><p>While the block in the example above is being used to store a single purchase from Amazon, the reality is a little different. A single block on the Bitcoin blockchain can actually store up to 1 MB of data. Depending on the size of the transactions, that means a single block can house a few thousand transactions under one roof.<br>
<b>Where exactly is this chain located?</b><br>
Due to the open nature of cryptocurrencies, and the importance of the public having access to other blocks, the blockchain isn’t located on just one guy’s large computer. For example, the bitcoin blockchain is actually managed by distributed nodes. These nodes all have a copy of the entire blockchain. Nodes will forever come and go, synchronizing their own copies of the chain with those of other users. By distributing copies and access, the chain can’t simply “go down,” or disappear. It’s a decentralized system that is both sturdy and secure.<br>
<b>Application IRL</b><br>
You have all these people, all over the world, who have bitcoin. There are likely many millions of people around the world who own at least a portion of a bitcoin. Let’s say one of those millions of people wants to spend their bitcoin on groceries. This is where the blockchain comes in.<br>When it comes to printed money, the use of printed currency is regulated and verified by a central authority, usually a bank or government—but Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone. Instead, transactions made in bitcoin are verified by a network of computers. This is what is meant by the Bitcoin network and blockchain being <em>decentralized</em>.<br>
<b>Mining Cryptocurrency</b><br>When one person pays another for goods using bitcoin, computers on the Bitcoin network race to verify the transaction. In order to do so, users run a program on their computers and try to solve a complex mathematical problem, called a <em>hash</em>. When a computer solves the problem by <em>hashing</em> a block, its algorithmic work will have also verified the block’s transactions. As we described above, the completed transaction is publicly recorded and stored as a block on the blockchain, at which point it becomes unalterable. In the case of Bitcoin, and most other blockchains, computers that successfully verify blocks are rewarded for their labour with cryptocurrency. This is commonly referred to as <em>mining</em>.<br>
<b>History</b><br>The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. That concept can be difficult to wrap our heads around without seeing the technology in action, so let’s take a look at how the earliest application of blockchain technology actually worked.<br>Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated hash trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block. But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.<br>In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”<br>With many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself at age twenty-seven, in no small part because of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As a buzzword on the tongue of every investor in the nation, blockchain stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, and secure.<br></p>

			<h4 class="modal-title">CRYPTOCURRENCY: THE FUTURE</h4>
		  </div>
		  <div class="modal-body">
<i><p>A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger or computerized database using strong cryptocurrency to secure transaction record entries, to control the creation of additional digital coin records, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.</p>	
<h2>How do cryptocurrencies work? </h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies use decentralised technology to let users make secure payments and store money without the need to use their name or go through a bank. They run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, which is a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.
</p>
<h3>Why would you use a cryptocurrency</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are known for being secure and providing a level of anonymity. Transactions in them cannot be faked or reversed and there tend to be low fees, making it more reliable than conventional currency. Their decentralised nature means they are available to everyone, although they can be complicated to set up and few stores accept them for spending.
As a new form of cash, the cryptocurrency markets have been known to boom suddenly, meaning a small investment can become a large sum overnight. 
This has led to a spur in professional and amateur speculators investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, seeing them either as a quick way to make returns or as part of an investment portfolio.
</p>
<h3>Most common cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><b>Bitcoin:</b> Bitcoin was the first and is the most commonly traded cryptocurrency to date.  The currency was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, a mysterious figure who developed its blockchain. It has a market capitalisation of around $128 billion as of May 2018. <br>
<b>Ethereum: </b>Developed in 2015, Ether is the currency token used in Ethereum blockchain, the second most popular and valuable cryptocurrency. Ether has a market capitalisation of around $56 billion as of May 2018. However, ether has had a turbulent journey. After a major hack in 2016 it split into two currencies, while its value at one stage it reached as high as $1,300 but it has previously crashed briefly to as low as 10 cents. It has proved hugely popular as a launch pad for other cryptocurrencies in 2017, which use the Ethereum blockchain's code.<br>
<b>Ripple: </b>(2012) Ripple can be used to track more kinds of transactions, not just of the cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with banks and financial institutions, including Santander. It has a market capitalisation of around $24 billion.<br>
<b>Litecoin: </b>This currency is most similar in form to bitcoin, but has moved more quickly to develop new innovations, including faster payments and processes to allow many more transactions. The total value of all Litecoin is around $6 billion.</p>
<h3>What Is a Smart Contract?</h3>
<p>A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible.
Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.
While blockchain technology has come to be thought of primarily as the foundation for bitcoin, it has evolved far beyond underpinning the virtual currency.</p>
